This project demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts using a fantasy-themed character battle simulator. The system includes a hierarchy of classes that showcase inheritance, polymorphism, method overriding, and composition. The base Character class defines shared attributes and behaviors such as attacking and taking damage. The Player class extends Character by adding player-specific features such as level, experience, and optional weapons. Three subclasses—Warrior, Mage, and Rogue—each override the attack() method to provide unique combat styles and special abilities. A separate Weapon class demonstrates composition by allowing player characters to equip items that add bonus damage. The provided SimpleBattle class enables straightforward testing of combat interactions between any two characters.

No additional creative features were added beyond the three required character types and their special abilities.

For AI usage, I used ChatGPT to assist with the entire project. AI generated and refined all class implementations and method definitions. Although AI contributed to every part of the project, I have carefully reviewed and studied all of the code to ensure understanding. 

To test and run the project, first clone your personal GitHub repository to your local computer using the command git clone [your-personal-repo-url] and then navigate into the project folder using cd [repository-name]. Once inside the directory, open a terminal or command prompt and run the main Python file with python Project2_starter.py. This will execute the program and display output showing each character’s stats, their different attack styles, and their unique special abilities. The program will also demonstrate a simple battle simulation between two characters using the provided SimpleBattle class. If your repository contains a tests/ folder, you can verify your implementation. These tests will confirm that inheritance, method overriding, and composition are all working correctly.
